# Five minutes research about golang.

Procedural.  
Good for speed (compiling and executing).   
No generics.  
No inheritance, prefers composition.   
Automatic implementation of interfaces if methods signatures match.  
Why interfaces if it is procedural?  
Statically typed.  
No pointers.  
Good for networking, distributed systems.  
Multithreading with go routines which slightly remains of .Net Tasks.
